Computing the ratings. Let's suppose we want to compute the average rating of the item "i", so "bi" is the average rating of product "i". The simple definition of the rating an item "i" is: "The Average Rating of an item is equal to the sum of the received ratings divided by the number of received ratings" N U is the number of rows (for the column corresponding to i) with value other than 0, i.e. the number of users that have provided a rating. If very few users (or only one) has given a rating, this is not a reliable measure. We can improve the reliability with the trick of adding a constant C at the divider; C is called the shrink term. "The Average Rating of item is equal to the sum of the received ratings divided by the number of received ratings plus a shrink factor" If N U is high, the average will not be much affected; if N U is small, the average will lower significantly. For Example: Suppose we have two restaurants; one of them has 1 rating equal to 5; another one has 100 ratings, all of them 5. Without using a shrink term, both restaurants have the standard average rating of 5. Using a C=10 instead, the first restaurant has an average of 0.45 and the second of 4.54. The shrinking term is a crude technique that helps to take into account the bias implicit when there are only few ratings for one item. There are more sophisticated approaches, but often they generate results quite similar to those obtained with the shrinking term. Another Example: Check on some recommender systems (e.g. Trip Advisor): you may verify that, for items with few ratings, the overall rating of an item is not based on the standard mathematical average
